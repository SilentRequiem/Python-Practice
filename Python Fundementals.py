If we wanted to make a program that askes for basic info, we'd do it in this way

User Inputs:      
Given name: Steve
Family name: Adams
Street address: 776 Brick Road
City and postal code: Paris HM34 67W

Code:
name = input("Given name: ")
lastname = input("Family name: ")
address = input("Street address: ")
extra_addy = input("City and postal code: ")

Result:      
Steve Adams
776 Brick Road
Paris HM34 67W

Code for Result:
print((name), lastname + "\ n" + address + "\ n" + extra_addy)
      
You may have noticed I printed all of that using only ONE LINE.
You can still do this in Python in the same way using \ n and other means.
I if you want to use a variable with it, put parenthesis around it THEN add the comma.
Since we confirmed the "," is basically a "+" with a space after it, this allows us to save time.
